# Overview

EIP-7702 gives superpowers to EOAs.

Specifically, it allows any EOA to "borrow" the code of any contract for a single transaction. To do so, an EOA owner would sign an _authorization_ that could then be submitted by anyone as part of the new transaction type. The owner can revoke an authorization by bumping an account nonce, or they can make an authorization that is valid in perpetuity. The authorization could be given for a single chain, or all chains at once.

This setup allows an EOA to mimic a smart contract account, particularly allowing transaction bundling, gas sponsorships, and custom ownership schemes.
